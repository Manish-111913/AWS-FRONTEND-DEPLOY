Logic for the ABC Analysis UI 
This first screen is the control center for the entire inventory management module. The logic here is responsible for displaying the correct items based on their classification and ensuring the navigation is seamless.
1. Data Initialization and Default View
The moment the owner opens this screen, the app performs a series of background operations.
* Trigger: The app loads the Inventory Management module.
* Data Source: The app fetches the complete list of all ingredients and their associated data (item name, total quantity, and consumption value).
* Default State: The app's state is set to active_category: 'A'. This ensures that the 'A-Items' tab is visually highlighted and that the corresponding data is displayed first.
2. Dynamic Data Filtering
The list of items displayed on the screen is not static. It's a filtered view of the total inventory list. The app uses the active_category from its state to determine which items to show.
* Core Logic: The app filters the complete inventory list based on the category attribute that was calculated by the ABC analysis logic. The filtering function would look something like this in pseudo-code:
* function getItemsForCategory(category_tag) {
*     return all_inventory_items.filter(item => item.category === category_tag);
* }
* Initial Display: Since the active_category is initially set to 'A', the app displays the list of A-Items first.
3. Tab Navigation Logic
The tabs (A-Items, B-Items, C-Items) are the primary user interface for controlling which list is displayed.
* Trigger: The owner taps on either the B-Items or C-Items tab.
* State Update: When a tab is tapped, the app updates its state by changing the active_category to the corresponding category ('B' or 'C').
* Dynamic Re-render: The UI then automatically updates to display the items that correspond to the new active_category. The process is a seamless cycle:
1. Owner taps C-Items tab.
2. App sets active_category to 'C'.
3. App re-runs the getItemsForCategory('C') function.
4. App displays the new, filtered list on the screen.
4. Item Card Logic
Each individual item in the list is a single, reusable component. The data it displays is dynamically populated from the filtered item list.
* Item Name: This is populated from the item.name attribute.
* Quantity/Unit: This is populated from the item.quantity and item.unit attributes.
* Value Tag: This is the visual representation of the ABC classification. It is populated from the item.category attribute.
o If item.category === 'A', display "High-Value Item."
o If item.category === 'B', display "Medium-Value Item."
o If item.category === 'C', display "Low-Value Item."

Logic for the Item Details Page 
This page is a masterclass in information architecture. It's designed to give the owner a complete picture of a single ingredient at a glance, but all the data you see is dynamic and must be updated in real-time.
1. The Single Source of Truth
* Trigger: This page is accessed when the owner taps on an item in the A-Items list. The app passes the unique Item ID of the selected item to this new page.
* Data Fetch: The app uses this Item ID to pull all relevant data from the inventory database. This includes not only the item's name and stock quantity but also supplier information, expiry dates, and all the metrics needed for the analytics cards.
2. The Dynamic Header
* Item Name & Quantity: The header is populated directly from the fetched data. The name and quantity are pulled from the item.name and item.quantity fields.
* Primary Supplier: The app pulls the item.supplier data, which is set by the owner during the initial setup of a new ingredient.
* Expiry Date & Countdown: This is a crucial, live piece of data. The app pulls the item.expiry_date and then calculates the number of days until that date. The text "15 Days Left" is not static; it's the result of a calculation: (item.expiry_date - current_date). If the date is passed, the text could change to "Expired" and be highlighted in red.
3. The Key Analytics Cards
Each card on this page is a visual representation of critical, live data.
* Low Stock Alert:
o Logic: The app checks the item.stock_quantity against a reorder_point value. The reorder point is a threshold that the owner sets for an item.
o Trigger: If item.stock_quantity is less than or equal to reorder_point, the "Alert" tag is displayed. The number "5 Items" is a placeholder for item.stock_quantity.
* Value:
o Logic: This is the item.consumption_value we calculated earlier. The number is formatted as a currency (e.g., "$12,450"). This gives the owner a quick financial snapshot of the item's importance.
* Usage:
o Logic: This data is pulled from the Daily Production Planning and Stock Out modules. The app calculates the percentage of the total stock that has been used over a set period (e.g., the last 30 days). The 60% is a dynamic value calculated by (total_quantity_used / total_quantity_in_stock) * 100.
* Waste:
o Logic: This is a key metric. It's calculated based on a waste log that the owner manages. The app sums up all the wasted quantity of this item over the month and displays the percentage: (total_quantity_wasted / total_quantity_used) * 100. This number directly highlights a potential problem for the owner.
4. Actionable Buttons
The icons in the top right corner are critical for owner interaction.
* Edit Icon: This button will take the owner to a page where they can edit the item's details (e.g., update the supplier or change the reorder point).
* Delete Icon: This button triggers a confirmation pop-up to delete the item from the inventory.

UI Logic for B-Items (
The logic for this screen is a direct extension of the filtering system we discussed for Image 1. The key difference is the deliberate reduction of information and a change in the user's possible actions.
1. The Filtered View
* Trigger: The owner taps the "B-Items" tab.
* Filtering: The app updates its internal state to active_category: 'B'. It then filters the complete inventory list to display only items where item.category === 'B'. The list now shows items like "Chicken Breast" and "Cooking Oil."
2. Reduced Item Card Details
Unlike the A-Items screen, the item card here is intentionally simplified.
* Key Information: The card only displays the item_name and the item.quantity in stock.
* Missing Details: The card does not show the "High-Value Item" tag. The visual confirmation of its category is its presence on this specific page.
3. The "Tap to Manage" Action
This is a critical UI element that separates the B-items from the A-items.
* Purpose: This is a clear call to action that directs the owner to a more detailed view if they need it. The purpose is not to provide immediate information, but to offer a path to it.
* Logic: Tapping anywhere on the item card will take the owner to the Item Details page (similar to the one in Image 2), but with a subtle difference. The category will be passed as a parameter to the next screen, which could be used to enable or disable certain analytics for B-items if the business rules require it.
4. The "Limited Management" Philosophy
The design of this page is based on a core business principle: spend less time on lower-priority tasks.
* Why it matters: The owner can quickly scroll through their B-items to get a general overview of stock levels without getting bogged down in analytics like usage and waste percentages. The detailed analytics are a click away, but they are not the default view. This design helps the owner stay focused on the most financially impactful parts of their business.

UI Logic for the Promotion Confirmation Modal (Image 4)
This modal is not just a simple pop-up; it's a critical point in the user journey where the owner makes a strategic decision. The app's job is to ensure this action is deliberate and that the consequences are clear.
1. The Trigger
* The modal is triggered when the owner taps the "Tap to manage" button on a B-item.
* The app recognizes that the item is a B-item and presents a very specific option: to promote it to an A-item.
2. The Core Logic: "Move to category A?"
* Dynamic Content: The text within the modal is fixed, but the action is tied to the specific item. The question "Move to category A?" is the only strategic option for B-items.
* Why not other options? This design is intentional. It prevents the owner from overthinking and keeps the process simple. The app has already determined that this item is a B-item, so the most likely strategic action is to promote it to the next tier, not to view its details or delete it.
3. The Action Buttons
The two buttons, "Move" and "Cancel," are a clear and simple user flow.
* "Cancel" Button:
o Logic: Tapping this button simply closes the modal. It has no effect on the item's data or classification. The owner is returned to the B-Items list.
* "Move" Button:
o Logic: This is the most important part. When the owner taps "Move," the app takes the unique Item ID and updates its category tag in the database.
o The Database Update: The app will send a request to update the item's category from 'B' to 'A'.
o The Dynamic UI Update: Once the update is confirmed, the app will automatically refresh the A-Items list and remove the item from the B-Items list. The owner will see the change happen in real-time.
4. The Bigger Picture
This seemingly simple pop-up is a powerful feature that gives the owner a level of manual control over the system's logic. As per the logic document you provided, this is a crucial step for managing an item that might be part of a new promotion or is gaining importance, even if its consumption value hasn't caught up yet. It's a key part of your app's "Management Logic" philosophy.
UI Logic for C-Items 
The C-Items list is the antithesis of the A-Items screen. It is designed to be a quick reference, not a deep-dive analytics tool. The core logic here is about efficiency and minimal interaction.
1. The Filtered View
* Trigger: The owner taps the "C-Items" tab.
* Filtering: The app updates its internal state to active_category: 'C'. It then filters the complete inventory list to display only items where item.category === 'C'. The list now shows items like "Table Salt."
2. The Simplified Item Card
This is the most stripped-down item card in the entire application.
* Key Information: The card only displays the item_name and the item.quantity in stock.
* Missing Details: This card has no "Tap to manage" button. The intentional lack of an action here prevents the owner from being drawn into managing these low-value items. The app's purpose is to say, "Don't worry about these unless you absolutely have to."
* The "Basic Item" Tag: The text "Basic Item" is a visual confirmation of the item's low priority. It's a static tag that is hardcoded for all C-items.
3. The Complete ABC Workflow
With this final screen, the entire ABC analysis module is complete. The full workflow is now a self-contained, logical loop:
1. A-Items (Image 1): The owner starts here. The app presents the highest-priority items with a clear "High-Value" tag. They are the focus of daily management.
2. Item Details (Image 2): When the owner taps on an A-item, they can access a detailed analytics view to make data-driven decisions on a specific item.
3. B-Items (Image 3): When the owner navigates here, the app displays a simplified list. The "Tap to manage" action is a gate that prevents them from spending too much time on these items.
4. Promotion Modal (Image 4): This is the strategic control point. The owner can manually override the system's logic and promote a B-item to an A-item.
5. C-Items (Image 5): This is the final and simplest screen. It's a list for at-a-glance reference. There are no analytics and no management options, because the app's logic has determined they are the lowest priority.
((SUMMARIZED VERSION:ABC
 Step 1: Calculate Total Consumption Value
This is the foundational step. The goal is to get a single, comparable number for every ingredient.
1. Iterate Through All Ingredients: Loop through every ingredient in your inventory.
2. Calculate Per-Item Value: For each ingredient, run this simple formula:
o consumption_value = total_quantity_used * average_cost_per_unit
3. Create a Data Set: Store this data in a temporary array or list that holds objects like:
4. {
5.     "item_name": "Chicken",
6.     "consumption_value": 1500
7. }
8. Calculate Total Inventory Value: As you go, keep a running total of the consumption_value for all items. This will be the total_inventory_value.
Step 2: Sort and Apply Pareto Principle
This is the most critical part of the logic. The goal is to sort the items and then use the total_inventory_value to assign categories.
1. Sort the Data: Take the data set you created in Step 1 and sort it in descending order based on the consumption_value.
2. Iterate and Categorize: Loop through your sorted data set. As you loop, keep a running total of the cumulative_consumption_value and a running total of the cumulative_items_count.
o A-Items (High-Value): While cumulative_consumption_value is less than or equal to 80% of the total_inventory_value, assign the category "A".
o B-Items (Medium-Value): Once you pass the 80% mark, continue the loop. While cumulative_consumption_value is less than or equal to 95% of the total_inventory_value (80% + 15%), assign the category "B".
o C-Items (Low-Value): For all remaining items, assign the category "C".
The Dynamic Logic That Solves Your Problems
This approach is dynamic because it doesn't rely on a fixed number of items per category. It uses the percentages, which means it will work perfectly whether you have 10 items or 1,000.
* Conflict Resolution: This logic is a single, sequential pass. There are no conflicts because each item is categorized based on its position within the percentage breakdown.
* Simple Onboarding: This logic runs in the background. The owner doesn't need to do anything but make sure the total_quantity_used and average_cost_per_unit data is correct, which your app's existing modules (Daily Production, Stock In) already handle.
* Perfectly Aligns with Your UI: The first screen you show the owner is the list of "A" items, since the logic will categorize them first. You don't have to do any extra work. You simply filter the list by the "A" category.
